# Converter Coding Challenge

## General Requirements

Create a NodeJS script that converts a simple Figma design to a Sketch file. Feel free to use external libraries to speed up the process of creating a Sketch file using NodeJS. In the first version of your script the tool should ONLY be able to convert rectangles. Please find below a dummy Figma file.

The following properties should be converted: 
- Size
- Fill
- Position
- Name

_Please note:_ All other properties are nice-to-have

Dummy File: (https://www.figma.com/file/D9oxWlZ1DCX79VsGfD8Qwr/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1)[https://www.figma.com/file/D9oxWlZ1DCX79VsGfD8Qwr/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1]

You can expect the Figma file to be public.

## Technical Details

- NodeJS, ideally with TS
- Submit a GitHub repo with your solution

## Time
